# MLlab

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/andb0t/MLlab.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andb0t)

This is an experimental platform independent machine learning library. Born from the desire to implement modern machine learning algorithms by hand, this project has grown considerably and provides now basic algorithms for various classification and regression tasks.


## Implemented algorithms
Please consult the [API](https://andb0t.github.io/MLlab/api/index.html) for detailed and up-to-date information on the algorithms, e.g. the implemented hyper parameters.

### Classification
- [x] random
- [x] k-nearest neighbors
- [x] decision tree
- [x] perceptron
- [x] multilayer neural network
- [x] logistic regression
- [ ] SVM with linear and non-linear kernel (see [here](http://alex.smola.org/teaching/pune2007/pune_3.pdf) or [here](https://oceandatamining.sciencesconf.org/conference/oceandatamining/program/OBIDAM14_Canu.pdf))
- [ ] naive Bayesian classification

### Regression
- [x] random
- [x] linear regression
- [x] polynomial regression with linear kernel
- [ ] naive Bayesian regression

### Misc
- [x] extension of linear models to polynomial dependencies via feature transformation
